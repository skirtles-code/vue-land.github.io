# Can you show me a large, open-source Vue project that I can study?

While this is a common question, in practice it is unlikely that you will learn much about how to write your own applications by studying other, large applications. Each application is different and one of Vue's strengths is the flexibility to use it in many different ways.

Large, open-source applications aren't going to be written as educational material. They are pragmatic solutions to specific problems, not idealistic examples. They will be full of compromises and workarounds that appear to violate best practices, and in most cases you aren't going to have a detailed explanation from the developers about why they felt that was the correct way to go.

That said, here are some examples:

- <https://github.com/elk-zone/elk>
- <https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb/tree/develop/packages/nc-gui>
- <https://github.com/directus/directus/tree/main/app>

While we've tried to pick good examples, we cannot vouch for the quality of the code in those applications. They are constantly being updated, and it isn't practical for us to review them in detail.

If you have any suggestions for applications we should include in the list above, please let us know on Vue Land. Likewise, let us know if you have any concerns about the quality of the code in the existing examples.
